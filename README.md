🚀 Flask + MS SQL Server CRUD Web App — From Scratch to Production!

Hello Connections! 👋
I’m excited to share a project I recently built — a fully functional CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) web application developed using Flask and Microsoft SQL Server.
This project was a great opportunity to combine backend logic with clean frontend design, delivering a smooth, database-driven user experience.

💻 What I Used:
 🔹 Flask for lightweight backend logic and routing
 🔹 SQLAlchemy + pyodbc to interact with MS SQL Server efficiently
 🔹 HTML, CSS, Bootstrap for a responsive and attractive frontend
 🔹 WTForms + Flask-WTF for safe and clean form handling
 🔹 Bcrypt for password hashing (used internally for future extensions)

🛠 App Capabilities:
🧑‍💻 Perform complete CRUD operations on database records
🧑‍💻 Dynamically render content using Jinja2 templating
🧑‍💻 Clean and responsive UI/UX built with Bootstrap
🧑‍💻 Modular and maintainable project structure
🧑‍💻 Built-in CSRF protection and data validation using WTForms

🗃 Database Interaction Highlights:
🧑‍💻 Connection to MS SQL Server through pyodbc
🧑‍💻 ORM mapping with Flask-SQLAlchemy for better abstraction
🧑‍💻 Error handling and transaction control to ensure data integrity

💡 Whether you're a beginner exploring Flask or looking to integrate SQL Server in your apps — this project can serve as a solid base for scalable and secure web systems.
